ðŸš— Car Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of a car based on its features such as brand, model, year, engine type, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. Accurate car price prediction can help individuals make informed decisions when buying or selling vehicles.

ðŸ§  Key Features
Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and encoding

Model training using multiple regression algorithms

Model evaluation with metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score

Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

Deployment-ready prediction pipeline

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
Python: Programming language

Pandas / NumPy: Data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization
